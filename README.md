# OBS-APM-Tracker
Tracks APM over past 5 seconds and outputs it to a text file which can be sourced in OBS.

## TODO
- Implement a UI that doesn't use MessageBox()
- Find a method to hide console that is faster that FreeConsole()
- Find a better method to decrement APM that doesn't spawn a thread everytime you press a key.
